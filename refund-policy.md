# Refund Policy

## Volunteer Refunds

There are three kinds of payments that volunteers make through the Sparks.Network: Reservation Payments, Accountability Amounts, and the Sparks Contribution.

### Reservation Payments

Some organizers require that you make a Reservation Payment when you confirm your spot.  This usually covers your heavily-discounted ticket to an event, or other things that the organizer spends money on in advance of the event.


### Accountability Amounts

### Sparks Contribution

The Sparks Contribution is added to every payment that you make through the Sparks.Network.
